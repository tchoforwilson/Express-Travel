# EXPRESS BOOKING BACK-END

In Africa, especailly in my country Cameroon, travelling is usually done by Inter-Urban bus agencies. This is due to the absence of other transport means like rail, air and water. It is either this other methods of travelling are absent, or lacking by infastructure and most at times the citizens can't afford the fee charge to travel using this other methods.

So inter-urban buses have become very popular means of travelling. But despite tit presence and with digitalization, the booking process is still manual and time consuming.

Customers who have to travel will leave their houses to the agency, wait in a qeue to book a seat and after booking their seat(s) wait for the departure time to reach before they can travel.

The booking method is usually done by the customer been presented a diagram of the bus structure  were he/she then choose(s) the seat(s) suitable for his/her comfort, pay the fee and is delivered a ticket then wait till the departure time.

This project and application EXPRESS BOOKING, aims at digitalizing this process and reduce time and cost.

It provided the following:

# 1. The Inter-Urban Bus agencies are registered into the system database.

# 2. Each agency is registered with the manager.

# 3. The manager can then now register other workers or users for their bus agency.

# 4. The manager and workers (users) can signup or login after they are registered.

# 5. The manager can add, delete, update workers information, register drivers, and buses.

# 6. Managers and users can then create travel.
